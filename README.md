# KP Framework (Knife of Paoding) 🔪🐄

**The "Prefrontal Cortex" for AI Agents: A Decentralized-Convergent-Linearized Task Planning Architecture.**

---

## 🚀 The Vision
Most AI Agents today are "near-sighted." They decompose goals into massive task trees but lack the metacognition to review the whole structure. This results in redundant actions and logical loops. 

**KP Framework** is a "logical scalpel" that prunes the chaos. By identifying cross-branch redundancies and re-aligning task dependencies, it transforms messy execution into a razor-sharp linear sequence.

## 🛠️ How it Works (The 3 Stages)
1. **Dispersion:** Raw decomposition of goals into a comprehensive task tree.
2. **Convergence:** The "Metacognitive" layer. It identifies identical or similar nodes across different branches and merges them.
3. **Linearization:** Re-mapping the graph into the most efficient, non-redundant execution chain.

## 📊 Comparison
| Feature | Traditional Planners (HTN) | KP Framework |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Structure** | Rigid Tree | Dynamic Relation Network |
| **Redundancy** | High (Repeats identical tasks) | Zero (Auto-merging) |
| **Execution Path** | Branch-by-branch (Blind) | Causal-Driven (Optimized) |

## 💻 Quick Start
To see the KP logic in action, run the core demo:
```bash
python main.py
